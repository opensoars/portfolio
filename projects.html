    <p>This is the place to see some of my work. I've worked on both <a href="https://opensoars.github.io">open</a> and closed source projects. Recently most of my projects have been closed source. Some of my open source projects are rather old, when I look back at them I always feel the need to improve almost everything (if only I had more time), which of course is a good sign!</p>
    <h2>Open source</h2>
    <ul class="post-list">
      {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li>
          <p>
            <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
            {{ post.oneline }}
          </p>
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <h2>Closed source</h2>
    <ul class=" post-list-closed">
      <li>Efficient development environment set-up for a few small starting companies</li>
      <li>3D photo gallery for a photographer</li>
      <li>In the past: various kinds of (basic) websites</li>
      <li>Development and installation of a custom home automation system</li>
      <li>Development and maintainence of custom development tools for various companies</li>
      <li>Currently in development: next-gen x-platform drawing and animation tool</li>

    </ul>
